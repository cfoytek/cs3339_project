  This program is a single threaded random restart hill climbing Travelling
  Salesman Problem solver with 2-opt local search heuristic. This program
  is heavily based on TSP_GPU.cu, authored by Molly O'Neil and Martin Burtscher,
  and is intended to be a fair-comparison-test between multithreaded and single-
  threaded TSP solvers using this algorithm. For more information about
  TSP_GPU.cu, visit http://cs.txstate.edu/~burtscher/research/TSP_GPU/.
